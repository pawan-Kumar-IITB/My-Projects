# Project 1 - Car Purchase Amount Predictions Using ANNs
You are working as a car salesman and you would like to develop a model to predict the total dollar amount that customers are willing to pay given the following attributes:

Customer Name
Customer e-mail
Country
Gender
Age
Annual Salary
Credit Card Debt
Net Worth
The model should predict:

Car Purchase Amount

# Project 2 - Traffic Sign Classification Using LeNet Network in Keras
In this case study, you have been provided with images of traffic signs and the goal is to train a Deep Network to classify them

The dataset contains 43 different classes of images.

Classes are as listed below:

( 0, b'Speed limit (20km/h)') 
( 1, b'Speed limit (30km/h)')
( 2, b'Speed limit (50km/h)') 
( 3, b'Speed limit (60km/h)')
( 4, b'Speed limit (70km/h)') 
( 5, b'Speed limit (80km/h)')
( 6, b'End of speed limit (80km/h)') 
( 7, b'Speed limit (100km/h)')
( 8, b'Speed limit (120km/h)') 
( 9, b'No passing')
(10, b'No passing for vehicles over 3.5 metric tons')
(11, b'Right-of-way at the next intersection') (12, b'Priority road')
(13, b'Yield') (14, b'Stop') (15, b'No vehicles')
(16, b'Vehicles over 3.5 metric tons prohibited') (17, b'No entry')
(18, b'General caution') (19, b'Dangerous curve to the left')
(20, b'Dangerous curve to the right') (21, b'Double curve')
(22, b'Bumpy road') (23, b'Slippery road')
(24, b'Road narrows on the right') (25, b'Road work')
(26, b'Traffic signals') (27, b'Pedestrians') (28, b'Children crossing')
(29, b'Bicycles crossing') (30, b'Beware of ice/snow')
(31, b'Wild animals crossing')
(32, b'End of all speed and passing limits') (33, b'Turn right ahead')
(34, b'Turn left ahead') (35, b'Ahead only') (36, b'Go straight or right')
(37, b'Go straight or left') (38, b'Keep right') (39, b'Keep left')
(40, b'Roundabout mandatory') (41, b'End of no passing')
(42, b'End of no passing by vehicles over 3.5 metric tons')
The network used is called Le-Net that was presented by Yann LeCun http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf

# Project 3 - Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes

The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.

The files contain one message per line. Each line is composed by two columns: v1 contains the label (ham or spam) and v2 contains the raw text.

# Project 4 - Bisection Method Algorithm

In this develped a algorithm or a method to improve the performance and usefulnness of bisection method algorithm. In bisection we need to guess the initial interval for root and it is so random to guess it. We will not sure about finding root in it so i developed a method to find this interval and this interval gives good results.
